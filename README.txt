LangChain is a powerful framework designed to help developers build applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently. 
It provides modular components that simplify interaction with LLMs, retrieval systems, memory, agents, and tools.

 Key Components of LangChain
LangChain is built around several core components, each designed for a specific purpose.

Component	Description
1️⃣ Prompts	Templates that structure input queries for LLMs.
2️⃣ LLMs	Interfaces to models like OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and more.
3️⃣ Memory	Stores conversation history for stateful interactions.
4️⃣ Chains	Sequentially connects multiple components (e.g., LLMs, memory, retrieval).
5️⃣ Agents	Dynamic decision-making systems that call external tools.
6️⃣ Tools	External functionalities like APIs, databases, and Python execution.
7️⃣ Retrievers	Fetches relevant data from vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS).
